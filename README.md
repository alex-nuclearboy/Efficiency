# Detection and reconstruction efficiency

The overall detection and reconstruction efficiencies were determined based on the Monte Carlo simulation for the signal reaction taking into account response of detection system and selection criteria applied in the data analysis and the Fermi momentum distribution of resonance N* in the N*-deuteron system according to the model described in N. Kelkar et al., Int. J. Mod. Phys. E28 1950066 (2019) and N. Kelkar, et al., Nucl. Phys. A996 121698 (2020).

The efficiency was calculated for each of the excess energy intervals as a ratio of the number of reconstructed to the generated events. 
For the generated events a detector response was simulated and the analysis was conducted taking into account the same selection criteria as for the experimental data. 

## Software

### ROOT 
ROOT is an object-oriented framework for large scale data analyses based on C++.
It was developed for experiments at CERN, in which an impressive amount of data has to be processed. It was originally designed for particle physics data analysis.
ROOT has an extensive library with modules in physics, mathematics, statistics, histograms and graphics. It contains statistics tools, which can be used for data analysis.
